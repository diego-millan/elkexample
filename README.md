 ElasticSearch with SpringBoot
 
 This project was created to demonstrate how to use Java with Spring Boot integrated with ElasticSearch.
 
 The dependency will be found at pom.xml.
 
 Domain have only one class, Movie, which is our Type, index name is configured to myindex, so, if you want to test this project, elasticsearch.yml must change default index to 'myindex' instead.
 
 A initial movies list is added automatically when application starts up (DemoApplication).
